Thank you for buying Dissonance Unity Voice Chat!

Dissonance needs a "network integration" which will make it work with a networking system. To download an integration go to:

    Window > Dissonance > Integration

This will show the welcome window which will take you to the page where you can download the correct integration.

To learn more about how to use Dissonance refer to the online documentation:
